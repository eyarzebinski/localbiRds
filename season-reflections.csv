Easter,"Easter is when we pull out all of the stops and infuse extra joy and extra life into our worship. Jesus is alive! The earth near Corhaven reflects this reality, too. You may see the snow start to melt and hydrate its surroundings. You may see trees and early spring flowers start to bud and bloom."
Ordinary Time (early),"Ordinary time begins with a rush of the high from Easter, and quickly moves into Pentecost and Ascension day. For the purposes of having a big enough range to generate accurate bird predictions, we folded Pentecost and Ascension into Ordinary Time (early). Maybe you are just putting away your celebratory white or red linens and exchanging them for green ones."
