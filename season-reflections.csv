Advent,"A time of waiting, yearning, reflecting. Advent comes in late November or early December and marks the start of the Christian calendar. O come and make all things new. O come, o come, Emmanuel.

Very few bird species are common around Corhaven in Advent, with most having migrated south to warmer climates for the winter. Of the birds that are around Corhaven, most are muted colors to reflect the winter environment around them, though keep an eye out for a flash of color from a Green-winged Teal. Even though most birds prevalent in this season are not very colorful, they make up for it with their larger size making them easier to spot. You will likely see some members of the duck, geese, and swan family floating on calmer waters or flying overhead. You may even hear the ducks making typical duck-like sounds."
Christmas,"Representing the time between December 25 and January 6 (the day before Epiphany), this small sliver on the Christian calendar nonetheless still sees birds around Corhaven. The American Black Duck, Green-winged Teal, and American Pipit have most commonly been reported around Corhaven, though others may be seen as a rare gift."
Epiphany,"Starting on January 7 and extending until Lent, Epiphany is a time when you can feel the earth _______________. Quite a few different bird families are common around Corhaven in this Christian season, including some hawks; swans, geese, and ducks; and sparrows. When there is snow on the ground, keep an eye on any low-to-mid height bushes as a place where the smaller birds congregate - especially if it is a berry bush! On particularly sunny days, you may see the typically skittery sparrows linger in the warm rays of sun just a little longer than usual. Keep an eye on dead, open tree branches or in the open sky to see hawks."
Lent,"Lent starts in February or March, and is a time of contemplation and self-denial. __________________"
Easter,"Easter, starting in March or April, is a time when we pull out all of the stops and infuse extra joy and extra life into our worship. Jesus is alive! The earth near Corhaven reflects this reality, too, as it rebels against the cold and makes its push towards warmer weather. You may see the snow start to melt and hydrate its surroundings. You may see trees and early spring flowers start to bud and bloom. Easter season can also include Spring migration."
Ordinary Time (early),"Ordinary time begins with a rush of the high from Easter, and quickly moves into Pentecost and Ascension day. For the purposes of this bird guide, we folded Pentecost and Ascension into Ordinary Time, and split Ordinary Time into two halves: early and late. Maybe you are putting away your celebratory white or red linens and exchanging them for green ones. There is much to still celebrate via the birds around Corhaven. Many different bird species are around in this season, ____________"
Ordinary Time (late),Ordinary time (late) continues with some birds starting to migrate south.
