Advent,"A time of waiting, yearning, and reflecting. Advent comes in late November or early December to mark the start of the Christian calendar. As we wait patiently for God's renewal, we call out: O come and make all things new. O come, o come, Emmanuel.

Very few bird species are common around Corhaven during Advent. Most have migrated south to warmer climates for the winter. Of the birds that you might see, most will have muted colors reflecting the winter environment around them (but keep an eye out for a flash of color from the occasional Green-winged Teal). Even though most birds you may see in Advent are not very colorful, they tend to be relatively large, making them easy to spot. You will likely see some members of the duck, geese, and swan family floating on calmer waters or flying overhead. You may even hear the ducks making typical duck sounds. -e"
Christmas,"Representing the time between December 25 and January 5 (the day before Epiphany), Christmas focuses us on the gift of the Incarnation, which is God's definitive pronouncement that creation is good and expresses God's nature as one who gives good gifts.

Perhaps to highlight the gift-nature of the season, few birds are common around Corhaven at Christmas. Thus, each one you see should be regarded as a rare gift. -k"
Epiphany,"Starting on January 6 and extending until Lent, Epiphany celebrates the manifestation of Jesus to the world. It is a time for the world to recognize and receive its rightful King, if only it knows where to look. How fitting that it coincides with the end of winter, when those who look carefully can see the first hints of new life returning to Virginia.

Quite a few different bird families are common around Corhaven during Epiphany, including some hawks; swans, geese, and ducks; and sparrows. When there is snow on the ground, keep an eye on any low-to-mid height bushes as a place where the smaller birds congregate - especially if it is a berry bush! On particularly sunny days, you may see the typically skittish sparrows linger in the warm rays of sunlight. Keep an eye on dead, open tree branches or in the open sky to see hawks. -e"
Lent,"Lent starts in February or March, and is a time for contemplation and self-denial. Spring is at hand, but it is not yet time to celebrate. That comes later, only after taking up our cross and following Jesus, the Man of Sorrows.

Likewise, it is too early to welcome the full range of migrating birds. Some new birds will start appearing, but many of them are draped in the dull plumage of their winter counterparts, demanding discipline to identify. -k"
Easter,"Easter, starting in March or April, is the time we have been waiting for all year. Jesus is alive! The Resurrection declares that Jesus is the world's rightful King. Death no longer has the final say, and God has turned creation right side up.

The earth reflects this reality, too, as the full bloom of spring arrives to defeat the cold of winter. You may see the snow start to melt and hydrate its surroundings. You may see trees and early spring flowers start to bud and bloom. Easter season also includes the peak of spring migration, welcoming a diverse number of species to Corhaven. Many of these birds are decked out in colorful plumage, as if wearing their best clothing to celebrate Easter. -e"
Ordinary Time (early),"Ordinary time begins with a rush from the high of Easter, and quickly moves into Pentecost and Ascension day. For the purposes of this bird guide, we folded Pentecost and Ascension into Ordinary Time, and split Ordinary Time into two halves: early and late.

Maybe you are putting away your celebratory white or red linens and exchanging them for green ones. But do not confuse what is *ordinary* for what is *insignificant*. The work of God and the Church continues, and so do the birds. If you are fortunate, you will see some wrens, flycatchers, and woodpeckers. -e"
Ordinary Time (late),"Ordinary time continues with some birds starting to migrate south. The weather gets colder and the days get shorter. Look out for our personal favorite, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet, or Bill Haley's personal favorite, the Pileated Woodpecker. -e"
