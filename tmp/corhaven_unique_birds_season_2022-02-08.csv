"Accipitridae: Kites, Hawks & Eagles",Bald Eagle,baleag,Ordinary Time,0.57,https://ebird.org/species/baleag,https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/285750461,"Majestic adults have blackish-brown body with white head and tail. Several stages of immature plumages aren't quite as majestic, from fully dark brown to messy and mottled with large patches of white. Look especially for white mottling on the belly on immatures. Scavenges and hunts near bodies of water. Soars with wings flat, like a large, dark plank. Head appears large in flight; projects far in front of wings. Surprisingly weak-sounding vocalization is a series of high-pitched whistles."
"Accipitridae: Kites, Hawks & Eagles",Cooper's Hawk,coohaw,Ordinary Time,0.62,https://ebird.org/species/coohaw,https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/50787721,"Small to medium-sized hawk with relatively short rounded wings and rounded tail. Adults are gray above with pale orange barring below; immatures are browner and streaky. Very similar to Sharp-shinned Hawk, but larger with bigger head. Also note deeper, slower wingbeats. Breeds in forested areas; more common in suburban areas than Sharp-shinned Hawk. Feeds mainly on birds captured in flight. Often stalks feeders in search of prey."

Perches on wires more frequently than Red-tailed Hawk. In flight, wings seem narrow and pushed forward compared to Red-tailed or Broad-winged Hawk; also note relatively long tail. Population in California is more richly colored (darker orange) than paler Eastern birds; while Florida birds are paler with gray head and back."

Some variation in color across range; birds in western North America and especially Central America are brownish, with limited white in the wing. Occurs in wooded habitats with large trees. Familiar visitor to backyard feeders, especially fond of suet. Calls include a loud “peek!” and a fast rattle, stronger than Downy Woodpecker."
Picidae: Woodpeckers,Northern Flicker,norfli,Easter,0.41,https://ebird.org/species/norfli,,"Large, brownish woodpecker with black barring on the back and black spots on the belly. Easily recognized in flight by its bright white rump. Also note large black crescent-shaped mark on breast. Wings and tail flash yellow or red, depending on the subspecies.

Scolopacidae: Sandpipers,Least Sandpiper,leasan,Easter,0.81,https://ebird.org/species/leasan,,"Tiny brownish sandpiper. At all ages, most easily distinguished from other small sandpipers by darker, more brownish coloration. Juveniles are particularly bright with rusty tones on the upperparts. Also note fine-tipped bill and yellowish legs, but beware legs can be covered with dark mud and other peeps (like Semipalmated Sandpiper) can rarely show slightly greenish legs. Habitat and behavior are helpful supporting clues, too. Typically forages in a crouched posture with bent legs, picking for invertebrates in the mud. Often in small loose groups, but not in large, tight flocks like Semipalmated or Western Sandpipers. Prefers drier mud, often on the higher edges of mudflats or small patches of water in marshes. Widespread and common, especially inland. Breeds in various wetland habitats throughout Alaska and Canada. Winters from the southern U.S. to South America. Listen for high-pitched, rolling “greeep!” calls."

Forages actively on mudflats and in shallow pools and marshes, often in loose mixed flocks with Greater Yellowlegs. Somewhat more likely to be found in smaller, marshier habitats than Greater, but much overlap.

Nonbreeding is plain gray above and white below. Juveniles have attractive scaly pattern on upperparts, and variable coloration: usually grayish with some buffy areas, occasionally brighter rufous. Most similar to Western and Least Sandpipers. Western averages slightly larger and longer-billed, with brighter rufous on breeding adults and juveniles; nonbreeding birds paler but extremely similar to Semipalmated. Least Sandpiper is darker and browner. Breeds on high Arctic tundra. Migrates to South America for the winter; very rarely lingers in the U.S. past November, unlike Western Sandpiper.
