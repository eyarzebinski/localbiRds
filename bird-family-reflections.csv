"Accipitridae: Kites, Hawks & Eagles","Birds in this family are known for their hooked beaks, which allows them to eat a varied diet, including fish, insects, mammals, and even other birds. They also have flight patterns with a few quick wingbeats and a long glide, which allows them to be surprisingly agile given their size. All of the birds in this section most commonly occur during Ordinary Time, with some additionally showing up during Ephipany and Lent. While these birds are typical to see in their seasons, you may not see them every day. We find that we still have an involuntary gasp when we see the size and power these birds in the wild."
Alaudidae: Larks,"Birds in this category eat seeds and insects and tend to be on the ground rather than in trees or bushes.

Alcedinidae: Kingfishers,"Members of this fun family have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails.

"Anatidae: Swans, Geese & Ducks","Even those new to birding have likely identified some of the birds in this category before.

Charadriidae: Plovers,"Plovers are a personal favorite of Evelyn's. These small birds run and stop abruptly when foraging, and are often found on ground very near water. Of the two plovers that have been identified near Corhaven, they can be distinguished by the number of black stripes on the neck."
Columbidae: Pigeons and Doves,"It is hard to mistake these birds for anything else. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of these birds, especially pigeons.
